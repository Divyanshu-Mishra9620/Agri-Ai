## Crop Diseases and Management

### Tomato Diseases

#### Late Blight (Phytophthora infestans)
Late blight is one of the most destructive diseases of tomato and potato crops worldwide.

**Symptoms:**
- Dark brown to black lesions on leaves, stems, and fruits
- White fuzzy growth on the underside of leaves in humid conditions
- Rapid spread during cool, wet weather
- Entire plants can be destroyed within days

**Management:**
- Use resistant varieties when available
- Apply fungicides preventively (copper-based or systemic)
- Ensure proper spacing for air circulation
- Remove and destroy infected plant material
- Avoid overhead irrigation
- Practice crop rotation with non-solanaceous crops

#### Early Blight (Alternaria solani)
Early blight affects older leaves first and can reduce yield significantly.

**Symptoms:**
- Concentric ring patterns on older leaves (target spots)
- Dark brown lesions with yellow halos
- Premature leaf drop
- Stem cankers near soil line

**Management:**
- Apply fungicides at first sign of disease
- Remove infected lower leaves
- Mulch to prevent soil splash
- Maintain proper plant nutrition
- Use disease-free seeds and transplants

### Rice Diseases

#### Blast Disease (Magnaporthe oryzae)
Rice blast is a major fungal disease affecting rice worldwide.

**Symptoms:**
- Diamond-shaped lesions on leaves with gray centers and brown margins
- Neck rot causes entire panicles to die
- Severe yield losses in susceptible varieties

**Management:**
- Use resistant varieties
- Balanced fertilization (avoid excess nitrogen)
- Proper water management
- Seed treatment with fungicides
- Remove infected stubble after harvest

#### Bacterial Leaf Blight (Xanthomonas oryzae)
A bacterial disease causing significant yield loss.

**Symptoms:**
- Water-soaked lesions along leaf margins
- Lesions turn yellow then brown
- Systemic infection in severe cases

**Management:**
- Plant resistant varieties
- Use certified disease-free seeds
- Balanced fertilization
- Proper water management
- Remove infected plants

## Fertilizer Recommendations

### NPK Requirements by Crop

#### Wheat
- Nitrogen (N): 120-150 kg/ha
- Phosphorus (P2O5): 60-80 kg/ha
- Potassium (K2O): 40-60 kg/ha

**Application Schedule:**
- Basal: 50% N + 100% P + 100% K at sowing
- First top dressing: 25% N at 21 days after sowing
- Second top dressing: 25% N at 40 days after sowing

#### Rice
- Nitrogen (N): 100-120 kg/ha
- Phosphorus (P2O5): 50-60 kg/ha
- Potassium (K2O): 40-50 kg/ha

**Application Schedule:**
- Basal: 50% N + 100% P + 50% K at transplanting
- First top dressing: 25% N at tillering stage
- Second top dressing: 25% N at panicle initiation
- Third top dressing: 50% K at flowering

#### Cotton
- Nitrogen (N): 150-180 kg/ha
- Phosphorus (P2O5): 60-75 kg/ha
- Potassium (K2O): 50-60 kg/ha

**Application Schedule:**
- Basal: 25% N + 100% P + 50% K at sowing
- First top dressing: 25% N at 30 days after sowing
- Second top dressing: 25% N at 60 days after sowing
- Third top dressing: 25% N + 50% K at flowering

## Pest Management

### Major Pests

#### Aphids
Small sap-sucking insects that transmit viral diseases.

**Control:**
- Natural enemies: Ladybird beetles, lacewings
- Neem oil spray (3-5 ml/liter)
- Yellow sticky traps
- Imidacloprid @ 0.3 ml/liter for severe infestations

#### Whiteflies
Transmit viral diseases and cause sooty mold.

**Control:**
- Yellow sticky traps
- Neem seed kernel extract @ 5%
- Thiamethoxam @ 0.2 g/liter
- Remove infected plants
- Reflective mulches

#### Bollworms (Cotton, Tomato)
Major pest causing direct fruit/boll damage.

**Control:**
- Pheromone traps @ 5/acre
- Bt sprays for young larvae
- NPV @ 250 LE/ha
- Spinosad @ 0.5 ml/liter
- Remove and destroy damaged bolls/fruits

## Irrigation Management

### Drip Irrigation
Most efficient method for water conservation.

**Benefits:**
- 40-60% water saving compared to flood irrigation
- Reduced weed growth
- Better fertilizer use efficiency
- Reduced disease incidence

**Recommended Crops:**
- Vegetables (tomato, capsicum, cucumber)
- Fruits (banana, pomegranate, citrus)
- Cotton, sugarcane

**Maintenance:**
- Clean filters regularly
- Flush laterals periodically
- Check for emitter clogging
- Maintain proper pressure

### Sprinkler Irrigation
Suitable for field crops and vegetables.

**Advantages:**
- 30-40% water saving
- Uniform water distribution
- Suitable for uneven terrain
- Can be used for frost protection

**Recommended Crops:**
- Wheat, maize, soybean
- Vegetables (cabbage, cauliflower)
- Fodder crops

## Soil Health Management

### Organic Matter
Maintaining 2-3% organic matter is crucial for soil health.

**Methods to Increase:**
- Green manuring with dhaincha, sunhemp
- Farmyard manure @ 10-15 t/ha
- Crop residue incorporation
- Compost application
- Vermicompost @ 5 t/ha

### Soil Testing
Regular soil testing (every 2-3 years) helps optimize fertilizer use.

**Parameters to Test:**
- pH
- Organic carbon
- Available N, P, K
- Micronutrients (Zn, Fe, Mn, Cu)
- Electrical conductivity

## Weather-Based Advisory

### Temperature Effects

**High Temperature (>40°C):**
- Reduce irrigation frequency but increase quantity
- Apply mulch to conserve moisture
- Provide shade nets for sensitive crops
- Schedule irrigation during early morning or evening

**Low Temperature (<10°C):**
- Risk of frost damage
- Use sprinkler irrigation for frost protection
- Apply potash to improve cold tolerance
- Delay sowing of sensitive crops

### Rainfall Management

**Heavy Rainfall Expected:**
- Ensure proper drainage
- Avoid fertilizer application
- Support tall crops to prevent lodging
- Delay irrigation
- Prepare for pest disease outbreak

**Drought Conditions:**
- Adopt deficit irrigation
- Use mulching
- Schedule irrigation at critical stages
- Select drought-tolerant varieties

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

### Components

1. **Cultural Practices:**
   - Crop rotation
   - Clean cultivation
   - Resistant varieties
   - Proper spacing

2. **Mechanical Control:**
   - Hand picking of insects
   - Traps (light, pheromone, sticky)
   - Bird perches
   - Removal of infected plants

3. **Biological Control:**
   - Trichogramma cards
   - Chrysoperla releases
   - Bt formulations
   - NPV applications

4. **Chemical Control:**
   - Last resort only
   - Use recommended doses
   - Rotate different groups
   - Observe pre-harvest intervals

## Post-Harvest Management

### Proper Storage
- Clean and dry storage facilities
- Maintain 12-14% moisture for grains
- Use hermetic storage for pulses
- Regular monitoring for pest infestation

### Grading and Packaging
- Remove damaged produce
- Sort by size and quality
- Use appropriate packaging materials
- Label properly with date and grade
